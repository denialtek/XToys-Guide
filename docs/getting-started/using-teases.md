# Using Teases

Teases are very similar to scripts. However unlike scripts which are largely meant to just be started in the background, teases are meant to be the main thing you're interacting with while a tease is active.

Teases display text, audio, video, and choices to you while they run and are designed to be watched while your toys react. This includes things like syncing your toys to a porn video, visual novel/interactive stories, or listening to hypnosis and repeating commands.

## Tease Info

When browsing teases you will be presented with multiple details about each tease.

## Using a Tease
